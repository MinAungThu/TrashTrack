# TrashTrack AI - Garbage Detection System

## What is TrashTrack AI?

TrashTrack AI is a simple prototype for detecting garbage using YOLOv6 (You Only Look Once) and the Roboflow platform. This project was created as part of the EEC Hackathon 2024. The model was trained on about 2000 garbage images to quickly show how garbage can be detected in images, but it's still a work-in-progress. The main idea is to provide real-time monitoring of littering in Thailand as well as provide types of garbage to accelerate garbage processing efforts.

## Usage

- **Detects Garbage:** The AI tracks and classifies the types of trash. 

- **Real-time Camera Feed:** The model can be connected to IP cameras to conduct real-time monitoring.

## Future Developments (Things to Improve)

- **Better Accuracy:** The model needs to be trained with more data to achieve better accuracy 
- **Robust Development and Deployment:** This prototype is only built with minimal flask and javascript without even utilizing database functions. A proper dashboard displaying the detected results and an alarm system for littering activities need to be developed.
