# TrashTrack AI - Garbage Detection System

## What is TrashTrack AI?

TrashTrack AI is a simple prototype for detecting garbage using YOLOv6 (You Only Look Once) and the Roboflow platform. This project was created as part of the EEC Hackathon 2024. The model was trained on about 2000 garbage images to quickly show how garbage can be detected in images, but it's still a work-in-progress. The main idea is to provide real-time monitoring of littering in Thailand as well as provide types of garbage to accelerate garbage processing efforts.

## Usage

- **Detects Garbage:** The AI tracks and classifies the types of trash. 

- **Real-time Camera Feed:** The model can be connected to IP cameras to conduct real-time monitoring. 

- **History of Results:** The app stores a history of everything the AI detects.

## Future Developments (Things to Improve)

- **Better Accuracy:** The model isnâ€™t perfect yet. Training it with more data could improve accuracy.
- **More Object Classes:** Right now, it only detects garbage. We could add more classes like recycling, plastic, paper, etc.
- **Deployment:** We could make this available online so more people can use it.
- **Mobile Version:** It would be awesome to have a version that works on smartphones!
